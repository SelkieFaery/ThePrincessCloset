Welcome to The Princess Closet!  Have you ever taken your little girl to the office holiday party and seen three
other little girls wearing the same dress from the local store?  My dresses are one of a kind, so
your little girl is guaranteed to have something unique!  I will never use the same material to make the 
same outfit more than once!  Everything you see at this shop, you will only see once!  I will also make 
custom orders made to fit you or your little girls size.
